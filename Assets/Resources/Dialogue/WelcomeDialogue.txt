Welcome to your new business! It may only look like an old abandoned wreck right now, but I'm sure with a bit of elbow grease and a whole lot of capital investment it'll become the most popular place in town. For now though, best just concentrate on ensuring it's presentable and not a health and safety issue.

I'm sure you'll wish to start off by getting some flooring and a lick of paint on the walls, along with a desk to complete your transactions. Once you've got those three things sorted, you can dress the place however you want, with whatever you want! Having different items in your store will bring in different types of clientelle and will generate different amounts of revenue depending on the time of year. Through completing different business objectives you'll unlock the ability to purchase different items and appliances, which will open up a wealth of possibilities to expand your business.

With all that said, let's get started!
